# Reddit Video Generator
Base/example code made for the fully automatic uploading of Reddit videos on YouTube.
guiMain.py is the main file

# Setup:
You won't be able to run this right off the bat. You need to install the necessary APIs and pip install the packages. 
To get everything working, you need to set up a Google Cloud account to get access to the TTS token and to get access to the automatic YouTube uploading.
You must also make a Reddit API account to get your tokens. There is also a ChatGPT reaction mode that can be released if anybody wants it. 

Some things in the code require certain files like databases, so you will also have to set up that. 
You will also have to provide a background for the Reddit video, along with an intro and outro, so just put the files in the proper places. 

# Additional:
The code in this repository must be given proper credit for its use. 
This code is meant to serve as an example of how Reddit Story content can be generated.
